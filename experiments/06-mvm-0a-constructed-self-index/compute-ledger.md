# MVM-0a compute ledger

*The registered budget instrument. Cap: **$200 for the entire registered
design** (learnability pilots, 5 seeds × full+twin, ablation passes, θ/δ
null-calibration, blind-localization arm) — adjudicated 2026-08-07,
derivations in `registration-decision-memo.md` §1. Once the registration
lands, exceeding the cap is a protocol violation, not just an overspend:
work stops and any continuation is a registered amendment.*

## Rules

1. **Every pod session gets a row** — written in the same session the pod
   is deleted, with the estimate recorded *before* the run and the actual
   after. STATUS entries already carry per-session costs by habit; this
   table is the running total against the cap.
2. **Estimate before spend.** A run whose pre-run estimate would take the
   running total past $200 does not launch.
3. **Pods always launch with `--terminate-after`** (standing ops rule), so
   no single run can exceed its own estimate by more than the terminate
   window.
4. **Reconcile against RunPod's own billing** (console → Billing) at each
   phase boundary (pilot → training → ablation → localization); the
   ledger's total and RunPod's lifetime-spend-since-2026-08-07 should
   agree to within a dollar, and a disagreement is investigated, not
   averaged away.
5. The hard backstop is upstream of this file: **the RunPod account is
   funded by prepaid credits with auto-reload OFF**, topped up in
   increments John chooses, never past the cap's remainder. The account
   physically cannot overspend what the ledger permits.

## Phase budget guide (from the decision memo, for estimates)

| phase | expected |
|---|---|
| Learnability pilots (10M → 30M → 100M as needed) | ~$1–15 |
| Registered training, 5 seeds × full+twin | ~$2 (10M) / ~$12 (30M) / ~$120 (100M) |
| Checkpoint ablation passes + RT-01 probes | ~$2–5 |
| θ/δ null-calibration runs | ~$2–5 |
| Blind-localization arm | ~$5 |
