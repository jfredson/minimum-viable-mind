# MVM-0a compute ledger

*The registered budget instrument. Cap: **$200 for the entire registered
design** (learnability pilots, 5 seeds × full+twin, ablation passes, θ/δ
null-calibration, blind-localization arm) — adjudicated 2026-08-07,
derivations in `registration-decision-memo.md` §1. Once the registration
lands, exceeding the cap is a protocol violation, not just an overspend:
work stops and any continuation is a registered amendment.*

## Rules

1. **Every pod session gets a row** — written in the same session the pod
   is deleted, with the estimate recorded *before* the run and the actual
   after. STATUS entries already carry per-session costs by habit; this
   table is the running total against the cap.
2. **Estimate before spend.** A run whose pre-run estimate would take the
   running total past $200 does not launch.
3. **Pods always launch with `--terminate-after`** (standing ops rule), so
   no single run can exceed its own estimate by more than the terminate
   window.
4. **Reconcile against RunPod's own billing** (console → Billing) at each
   phase boundary (pilot → training → ablation → localization); the
   ledger's total and RunPod's lifetime-spend-since-2026-08-07 should
   agree to within a dollar, and a disagreement is investigated, not
   averaged away.
5. The hard backstop is upstream of this file: **the RunPod account is
   funded by prepaid credits with auto-reload OFF**, topped up in
   increments John chooses, never past the cap's remainder. The account
   physically cannot overspend what the ledger permits.

## Reconciliation baseline

RunPod balance at adjudication (John, checked 2026-08-07): **$106.73**
(prior spend from $150 predates this cap — Experiment 1 / Stage 3 work;
this ledger starts at $0). Rule 4 reconciles against this number:
expected balance = $106.73 − ledger running total − storage drip since
this date. Auto-reload: **OFF** (John's setting; the Layer-3 backstop).

## Ledger

| date | phase | what ran | GPU | hrs (est → act) | $ est | $ actual | running total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-07/08 | pilot | 10M learnability pilot, seed 0, code `e0bd13e`, 171.79M tok (20/param), held-out eval. Pod 1 `977cezdx6klgbt` (secure 4090, deleted before use — dead `sshCommand` field, pod was healthy); pod 2 `zv0nxkyazqfw0w` (community 5090, ran the pilot). **RESULT: LEARNS, all batteries ≥0.97** (`pilot-findings.md`) | 4090 $0.74 (12.6 min) + 5090 $0.69 community | 1–2.5 → 2.4 (+0.2 dead pod) | $1.50 (cap $2.96) | **$6.02** ⚠ | **$6.02 / $200** |
| 2026-08-09/10 | pilot (A1, 30M) | **30M A1 pilot** — ladder rung 2 per the smallest-that-learns rule (10M FAILED, `pilot-a1-findings.md`). 39,204,192 actual params × 20 tok/param = 784.08M tokens ≈ 102k steps, batch 128, seed 0, held-out eval + T_sr_rev split. H_scale vs H_shortcut-starvation, signatures pre-stated. **Venue: H100 SXM secure** ($2.99/hr — compresses ~32–44h community wall-clock to ~11–16h and avoids the community-row billing anomaly); crash-resume support added to train.py (opt state in checkpoints, --resume; resume-after-crash needs a fresh C2 go). John's go: "Fire it" (2026-08-09). 24h terminate-after backstop. Pod `6bplni87uzp3ss` launched 23:54Z at **$3.29/hr** (above the remembered $2.99); **measured pace at step 500: 0.70 s/step, 83% util → revised in-flight est ~20h / ~$65**, completion ≈ 19:50Z 08-10, ~4h inside the backstop; crash-resume (fresh C2 go) covers a terminate-kill. **OUTCOME (discovered 2026-08-12): the pod died between sessions with no fetch — checkpoint, eval results, and train.log all LOST (written to container disk, not the network volume). Balance-derived bill ~$96 ≈ 29.3h @ $3.29/hr — ~5.3h PAST the 24h backstop; see 08-12 reconciliation below. The run produced nothing recoverable; the 30M rung must re-run (fresh C2 go, after process fixes).** | H100 SXM secure $3.29/hr (5090 community fallback) | est 11–16 → ~29.3 (balance-derived) | $33–48 (revised ~$65 at measured pace) | **~$96 balance-derived** ⚠ (console rows pending) | **~$104 / $200** ⚠ |
| 2026-08-09 | pilot (A1) | **A1 10M pilot** per §Amendment A1.6 — pod `3ethp3bc7le6e4` (5090 community), launched by John ("Fire", C2), 22,369 steps / 171.79M tok in 2.78h train (2.86h pod), checkpoint fetched (md5 `bab56cd8…`), pod deleted, zero pods confirmed. **RESULT: 10M FAILS ceiling (T_si 0.37, T_sr_rev 0.00) → ladder climbs to 30M; gate (iii) PASSES on this checkpoint** (`pilot-a1-findings.md`) | 5090 community $0.69/hr | est 2.5–3.5 → 2.86 | $2.40 (cap $9) | **$1.26 accruing** (billing row incomplete at fetch; nominal-from-lifetime $1.97; reconcile at phase boundary — NB the 08-08 anomaly row *grew* overnight, 8.47h→9.41h / $5.86→$6.52) | **~$8.0 / $200** (6.02 + ~2 est) |

**⚠ 2026-08-12 reconciliation: FAIL — 30M pod outlived its backstop; account drained to −$0.07.**
Discovered when John's RunPod low-balance notification prompted a check
(no session ran between the 30M launch 08-09 23:54Z and 08-12). API
state at 2026-08-13 01:54Z: **clientBalance −$0.07, zero pods**, network
volume `mvm-models` (150 GB, EUR-IS-1) still present and dripping
$0.015/hr (~$10.80/mo) against the negative balance. Balance-derived
totals (rule-4 anchor is the balance; per-row split is estimated):
$106.73 − (−$0.07) = **$106.80 spent since 08-07** = $6.02 (row 1)
+ ~$2.00 (A1 10M row) + ~$2.40 (volume drip, ~6 days) + **~$96.4 (30M
pod)**. At $3.29/hr that is **~29.3h billed against a 24h
terminate-after** (max-at-backstop $78.96). Two candidate explanations,
console billing rows needed to distinguish: (a) `--terminate-after`
never fired and RunPod killed the pod on balance exhaustion
(~08-11 05:10Z); (b) the pod died at the backstop but the row billed
~1.22× its existence (milder cousin of the 08-08 3.5× anomaly).
**Consequences:** checkpoint/evals/train.log lost (container disk,
never fetched — no session was scheduled inside the
completion→backstop window); the Layer-3 prepaid backstop held (no
card charge, stopped at $0); running total ~**$104/$200** with nothing
recoverable from the largest row. **NB the phase-budget guide below is
now known-stale:** it prices the 5-seed 30M at ~$12, but the measured
30M pilot alone cost ~$65–96 — at measured pace the remaining
registered design does not obviously fit the remaining ~$95. Open
items (John): reconcile console billing rows against the ~$96/~$2
split; top up or delete `mvm-models` (deletion risk: RunPod removes
volumes on unfunded accounts); adjudicate cap arithmetic before any
re-run.

**⚠ 2026-08-08 reconciliation: PARTIAL FAIL — investigated, unresolved.**
Balance $106.73 → $99.93 agrees with RunPod's billing rows ($6.02 pods +
~$0.78 volume drip since Aug 6), so nothing is unaccounted. But the 5090
row itself bills **8.47 h against ~2.42 h of pod existence (~3.5×,
$5.86 vs ~$1.67 expected)**; nvidia-smi showed one GPU. Actual recorded
from the billing rows per rule 4 (their number, not ours). **Ticket
waived by John (2026-08-08)** — the anomaly stands unexplained on
RunPod's side and is priced in: 5-seed-run estimates below assume the
~3.5× rate may recur (~$20–40 instead of ~$6–12). Still inside the cap.
For the record: the pod was NOT left running — deleted 2.4h after
creation, zero pods confirmed; the discrepancy is inside the billed row.

## Phase budget guide (from the decision memo, for estimates)

| phase | expected |
|---|---|
| Learnability pilots (10M → 30M → 100M as needed) | ~$1–15 |
| Registered training, 5 seeds × full+twin | ~$2 (10M) / ~$12 (30M) / ~$120 (100M) |
| Checkpoint ablation passes + RT-01 probes | ~$2–5 |
| θ/δ null-calibration runs | ~$2–5 |
| Blind-localization arm | ~$5 |
