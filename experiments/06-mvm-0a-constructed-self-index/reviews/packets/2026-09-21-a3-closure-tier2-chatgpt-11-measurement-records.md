# A3 seeds 1 and 2 — registered L0 endpoint

*2026-09-17. Local, $0, inference only. Run through `endpoint_a3.py`,
which was validated against the pilot first and reproduces its published
endpoint to the digit. Gated on John's threshold lock, which supplies
θ = 0.1777 on the primary battery and carries no threshold at all for the
control battery. Checkpoints verified by checksum.*

## What the wave was for, and what it answered

The ledger row staked the wave on two questions: whether the primary
battery's learnability **replicates**, and whether the control battery's
failure is a **seed lottery**. Both now have answers.

**Learnability replicates.** **The control is not a lottery; it fails on
every seed.**

## The primary battery

Across six independent evaluation seeds at n=800, reported as a spread
rather than a single draw:

| checkpoint | intact | under L0 | ceiling-corrected drop | vs θ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| pilot (seed 0) | 0.5683 (sd 0.0076) | 0.1988 (sd 0.0173) | 1.337 (sd 0.057) | 7.5× |
| seed 1 | 0.5633 (sd 0.0316) | 0.2015 (sd 0.0215) | 1.342 (sd 0.103) | 7.6× |
| seed 2 | 0.5738 (sd 0.0284) | 0.1447 (sd 0.0127) | 1.528 (sd 0.068) | 8.6× |

Three checkpoints trained from different seeds land within 0.011 of each
other on the intact score. Zeroing the acting channel collapses all three.
Every drop clears the locked threshold by between seven and nine times,
and a drop above 1.0 means the lesion took the battery **below** what an
ownership-blind solver reaches.

This is as clean a replication as the design can produce. The objective is
learnable and the learning genuinely depends on ownership.

## The ownership-free controls

| checkpoint | state battery drop | syntax battery drop |
|---|---|---|
| pilot (seed 0) | +0.0018 | 0.0000 |
| seed 1 | +0.0002 | 0.0000 |
| seed 2 | **+0.0769** | 0.0000 |

The syntax battery does not move at all on any checkpoint. The state
battery is untouched on two and moves 0.0769 on seed 2, which is forty
times the others.

**That does not fire** — the locked threshold for the state battery is
0.1172 and 0.0769 is well inside it — but it is reported rather than
rounded away, because it is the only asymmetry in the table and a
write-up that shows the other two without it would be flattering.

## The control battery, which is the finding

| checkpoint | intact | its ownership-blind ceiling | learned? |
|---|---|---|---|
| pilot (seed 0) | 0.2877 (sd 0.0302) | 0.3227 | no |
| seed 1 | 0.3057 (sd 0.0281) | 0.3227 | no |
| seed 2 | 0.3195 (sd 0.0150) | 0.3227 | no |

**On all three checkpoints the control battery sits below its own
ownership-blind ceiling.** A battery scoring under the level a solver
reaches without knowing which agent it is has not learned the task. Seed
2 comes closest, 0.3195 against 0.3227, and still does not clear it.

The consequence is mechanical. The registered floor rule leaves a
battery's drop **undefined** when its baseline is below its ceiling, so
the control's drop is undefined on every checkpoint, and the registered
differential clause — the primary's drop minus the control's — **cannot
be evaluated on any of the three.**

> **CORRECTION, 2026-09-17.** The sentence above understates the bar and
> is corrected here rather than rewritten. The floor rule is not
> "baseline below ceiling"; it is **baseline minus ceiling below 0.10**.
> So the control needs **0.4227**, not 0.3227, for its drop to be
> defined, and the three checkpoints miss by 0.135, 0.117 and 0.103
> rather than by the 0.035, 0.017 and 0.003 the table implies.
>
> No conclusion changes — the clause is uncomputable either way — but the
> gap is four to forty times wider than the table suggests, and an
> Amendment A4 that merely cleared the ceiling would still leave the drop
> undefined. See `control-battery-proposal.md`.

John ruled seed 0 not testable on the differential clause on 2026-09-16.
That ruling now extends to the whole wave, not by a further ruling but by
the same arithmetic applied to two more checkpoints.

## What this settles, and what it does not

**Settled: the control battery does not learn under this design.** Three
seeds, one outcome. It was the modal case the ledger recorded against the
wave before the go was given, and it came true. A recorded case-against
that comes true is worth more than a prediction that does not, and this
one removes the remaining hope that the control was a lottery.

**Therefore A3 as registered cannot return a positive on any checkpoint
it has.** Not because the primary failed — it succeeded on all three, by a
wide margin — but because the clause that compares it to a control cannot
be computed when the control never learned.

> **ANNOTATION, 2026-09-17. The conclusion stands; the reason given here
> is wrong and is corrected.** The clause cannot be computed **whether or
> not the control learned**. Its ownership-blind ceiling is 1.0, so a
> defined drop would need a baseline of 1.10 and no model can reach it.
> The clause was unsatisfiable from registration, months before any
> checkpoint existed, and the control's failure to learn is beside the
> point. Measured at `ceiling-measurement-findings.md`.

**Not settled, and not touched here: where ownership lives.** L0 removes
an input channel. It shows the action depends on ownership; it does not
show the network built an internal structure carrying it. That is the
question the localization work was for, and yesterday's runs leave it
open, with the stack unvalidated at this scale.

## For the 2026-10-04 decision

The control-battery question now has its evidence. The choice is between a
registered Amendment A4 that makes the control learn, and closing A3 with
partial discriminators and saying so plainly. Whichever way it goes, the
proposal should carry three facts from this wave: the primary replicates
tightly across seeds, the control fails on all three rather than some, and
the ceiling adjudication permits exactly one amendment to the compute cap,
so an A4 needing new runs must make that argument explicitly.

> **CORRECTION, 2026-09-17. The last clause is withdrawn as misleading.**
> The single-amendment rule bars a **raise** above the $400 ceiling. An
> Amendment A4 that fits inside the existing ceiling is not a raise and
> needs no cap amendment at all. Three retrained seeds cost $27 to $39
> against $184.3 of remaining headroom and $65.69 left on the A3 stop, so
> money is not the binding constraint on this decision and I should not
> have implied it was.

## Method notes, recorded honestly

- Every figure is a mean across six evaluation seeds with its spread, not
  a single draw. Intact and lesioned are paired within each seed, so the
  drop is not exposed to between-seed noise even though the levels are.
- The pilot's published 0.506 and its 1.515 drop both came from the single
  default evaluation seed. Its typical values are 0.5683 and 1.337, so
  that seed flatters twice. The conclusion is unaffected; the headline
  number was simply lucky.
- The six seeds used here are the first six of the twelve in yesterday's
  noise measurement, so the spreads quoted understate the fuller estimate
  at this sample size. The wider one is the better figure.
- The control battery is reported and never read for a verdict, which is
  what the lock enforces by carrying no threshold for it.

# The control battery's ceiling is 1.0, and the clause was never computable

*2026-09-17. Method committed before running at
`ceiling-measurement-method.md` (`2fba2ea`). No checkpoint loaded, no
inference, no spend. 4,000 episodes.*

## Verdict: A — STRUCTURALLY UNSATISFIABLE

**The registered differential clause could never have been computed. Not
by these models, not by any model, at any training budget, on any
architecture. It has been dead since registration.**

## The harness proved itself first

Both known-answer checks reproduced their registered values **exactly**,
to four decimal places, before any new number was reported:

| check | measured | registered |
|---|---|---|
| control, name-blind reference | 0.3227 | 0.3227 |
| primary battery reference | 0.2921 | 0.2921 |

So the harness reproduces the registration's own arithmetic. What follows
is not a different calculation quietly substituted.

## The measurement

| solver | score |
|---|---|
| name-keyed lookup | **1.0000** |
| registered name-blind reference | 0.3227 |
| learned attack | **1.0000** |
| **best of family** | **1.0000** |

Two independent solvers reach a perfect score. The hand-written one reads
the marker in the question, finds that marker's turn for the queried item,
and applies the shared revision rule. The learned one was given only
ownership-blind features and found the same structure by itself.

Neither touches the model's own slot or the acting channel. A scan of the
code, with docstrings and comments stripped, enforces that.

## Why this kills the clause

The floor rule defines a battery's drop only when
`baseline − ceiling ≥ 0.10`.

With a ceiling of 1.0, a defined drop needs a baseline of **1.10**.
Accuracy cannot exceed 1.0. So the control battery's drop is undefined for
**every possible model**, including a hypothetical one scoring a perfect
1.0, which would give a denominator of exactly zero.

The registered signature requires the primary battery's drop **minus the
control's**. One of its two terms can never exist.

## The reason is not what we thought, and the correction matters

Until today the record said A3 could not return a positive **because the
control battery never learned**. That conclusion was right and the reason
was wrong.

The control's failure to learn is **beside the point**. A perfectly
learning control would have made no difference whatever. The clause was
unsatisfiable the day it was registered, months before any checkpoint
existed.

**This also moots the proposal I wrote this morning.** Both routes I
offered, extra supervision and a scaffolded intermediate question, aimed
at making the control learn. Neither would have fixed anything. I was
proposing to spend $27 to $39 on a repair to the wrong component, and I
would have recommended it had this measurement not been run first. John's
instruction to measure the ceiling before opening an amendment is what
caught it.

## The structural point, which generalises past A3

This is not a slip in one number. It follows from two registered choices
that are individually reasonable and jointly incoherent.

1. The control battery is **designed to be answerable without ownership**.
   That is its entire purpose: same binding demand, no self-reference.
2. The metric divides by the distance from baseline to the **best score an
   ownership-blind solver reaches**.

Any control that is fully determined by the visible episode and does not
require ownership has an ownership-blind ceiling of 1.0 by construction.
Divide by the distance to 1.0 and you divide by zero or less.

**So the ceiling-corrected metric and the concept of an ownership-free
control are incompatible by construction**, not by accident. Any future
design pairing them inherits this, which is why it is worth reporting
upstream rather than filing as an A3 defect.

Worth stating fairly: the ceiling denominator was itself a registered
revision, adopted because dividing by chance manufactured a spurious
differential of 0.035 between the two batteries. That was a real problem
and the fix was a real fix. It simply traded a small artifact for an
unsatisfiable clause, and nobody noticed because the control never got
close enough to its floor for anyone to check the arithmetic.

## What this does not change

**The primary result is untouched.** Its ceiling is 0.2921, the models
score about 0.57, so its drop is well defined and enormous, between 7.5
and 8.6 times the locked threshold. Nothing here bears on it.

**No verdict is reopened.** Every finding that said the comparison was
uncomputable remains correct. Only the explanation changes.

**The other batteries are fine.** The state battery's ceiling is 0.0676
against a baseline of 1.0. The problem is specific to a control designed
to be ownership-free.

## What it means for 4 October

The question is no longer whether to make the control learn. **It is
whether the clause can be repaired at all, and if so whether repairing it
is a metric change rather than a training change.**

That is a different decision from the one the proposal framed, and it
should be re-framed before the date. I am not proposing the repair here,
because a metric change after seeing which way it cuts is exactly the move
this programme forbids, and because John decides whether the line
continues at all.

**No spend. No registered text altered.** This measurement is itself
unregistered, and says so.

# REGISTERED DEFECT — the control battery's ceiling was never verified

*2026-09-17. **Registered on John's instruction, before any further
analysis**, and independent of how the control-battery decision goes on
4 October. Local, $0. Nothing in the registered text is altered; §4 of the
amendment carries a dated notice pointing here.*

John's instruction, quoted: *"Register the ceiling defect now, before any
further analysis. Include the 0.5 vs 0.3227 documentation mismatch and the
fact that the solver ignores the supplied name."*

## The defect in one sentence

The registered text says both battery ceilings were **verified by the
attack sweep**. Only the primary battery's was. The control battery's
ceiling has never been attacked, and the single solver that produced it
ignores the one piece of information the control question supplies.

## What the registration claims

Amendment A3, §4 of the registration revisions, "The ceilings are measured,
not asserted":

> **Registered:** **0.2921** for the primary battery and **0.3227** for the
> control, measured on the registered grammar and **verified by the attack
> sweep, whose best ownership-blind attack reached 0.3036 on 12,000
> episodes — one standard error from the analytic value.**

The 0.3036 figure is an attack on the **primary** battery, compared against
the primary's 0.2921. It says nothing about the control. The sentence
attaches one verification to two numbers.

## Evidence, each checkable

**1. The attack sweep contains no control-battery code at all.** Searching
`src/shortcut_sweep.py` for the control battery's name returns **zero**
occurrences. The module attacks the primary battery only. So the clause
"verified by the attack sweep" is false as applied to the control, and the
0.3227 rests entirely on one reference solver in `curriculum_a3.py`.

**2. That solver ignores the name the question supplies.** The control
question names the agent it asks about, in the form *"where did
&lt;marker&gt; assign &lt;item&gt; to next?"*. The reference solver in
`measured_ceilings` never reads that marker. It forms all four agents'
successors on the queried item, strikes any already visible as a revision,
and guesses uniformly among the rest. Its score is therefore the score of
a solver that **cannot read names**, averaging 0.3227 over candidate sets
of size four, three and two.

**3. So 0.3227 is not a ceiling on this battery.** Every turn renders the
speaker's marker in plain text, so a solver that can do ordinary
name-keyed lookup retrieves the named agent's value and applies the
revision rule to it. Such a solver answers correctly every time. The
control battery's real ownership-blind ceiling is therefore **near 1.0 and
currently unmeasured**, not 0.3227.

That is coherent with the battery's purpose rather than a contradiction of
it. The control was designed to carry the same binding demand **without
self-reference**, so knowing which agent you are is irrelevant to
answering it. A solver blind to ownership should do well on it. What went
wrong is that the number recorded as its ceiling came from a solver blind
to something else entirely.

**4. The documentation mismatch, which predates the first dollar.** The
curriculum module's own description of the control battery states a
different figure:

> *"Two of the item's four values are struck by the two revisions a solver
> can invert, so its lookup ceiling is **0.5** — higher than T_act's, which
> **red-team pass 3 should weigh**, since the H_generic-binding bin turns
> on the difference between the two batteries' drops."*

So the registered number is 0.3227 and the module says 0.5. The comment
also names the exact risk and assigns it to a specific review. **Red-team
pass 3 ran and did not weigh it.** Neither figure has ever been checked
against an adversary.

## What follows, and what does not

**This does not change any result.** The control battery scored 0.2877,
0.3057 and 0.3195 on the three checkpoints. Against a floor requirement of
ceiling plus 0.10, it fails at 0.3227 and fails by more at 0.5 and fails
by far more at a true ceiling near 1.0. **Every reading makes the control
less learned, not more.** No verdict moves.

**It does change what the number means.** The metric divides the drop by
the distance from baseline to ceiling. For the control that denominator
was never a meaningful quantity, so the registered differential clause
rested on a yardstick nobody had checked. That is worth knowing whether or
not the clause was ever computable.

**It is a defect in a registered instrument, not in a result.** Recording
it is not a correction to a finding. It is a correction to the
registration's own claim about how one of its numbers was established.

## Consequences John has already set

**If A4 opens, measuring the control's ceiling properly is a precondition
of the amendment** (John, 2026-09-17). An amendment built on an unverified
denominator would inherit this defect.

**If A3 closes**, this belongs in the write-up as a limitation of a
comparison that was never actually available, alongside the fact that the
comparison could not be computed anyway.

**No ceiling is measured in this note.** Measuring it is the precondition
above, and John's instruction was to register the defect before further
analysis. Nothing here authorises spend, and nothing here changes
registered text.

## How this was found

Not by review of the registration, which had passed three red-team passes
with the mismatch sitting in the module's own docstring the whole time. It
surfaced from asking a narrower question, why the control battery failed
to learn, and reading the code that defines it. The original comment
predicted the exact failure mode and named the review that should have
caught it. The lesson worth keeping is that a warning written into the
code is not a warning anyone has read.

# The control battery does not learn when it is properly supervised

*2026-09-20. Unregistered diagnostic. Question and outcome cells were
written and committed **before the code existed** (`control-learnability-pilot.md`,
commit `7eee3c5`); the boundaries below are John's, set before any number
came back. No registered verdict is read here and John's threshold lock is
not touched. Cost: **$9.9** for the run plus **$0.067** to recover the
checkpoint.*

## Verdict: DID NOT LEARN — supervision is not the binding constraint

The control battery was given a loss term of its own, at double weight,
on half the training rows instead of about a third — **its per-row
gradient weight quadrupled and its share of the query gradient went from
about a third to about two thirds.** It scored **0.3125**.

The three existing checkpoints, trained without any of that, scored
0.2877, 0.3057 and 0.3195.

**The intervention moved nothing distinguishable from seed variation.**

## The numbers

Full registered budget — 55,116 steps, 585,552,384 tokens, identical to
the A3 pilot and seeds 1 and 2. Six independent evaluation seeds at
n=800, intact and lesioned paired within each seed.

| battery | intact | under the input-channel lesion |
|---|---|---|
| **control (T_other)** | **0.3125** (sd 0.0240) | 0.2613 (sd 0.0258) |
| primary (T_act) | 0.5727 (sd 0.0212) | 0.1663 (sd 0.0135) |
| state | 0.9960 (sd 0.0022) | 0.9787 (sd 0.0094) |
| syntax | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |

**Against John's pre-stated cells:**

| boundary | distance | in standard deviations |
|---|---|---|
| DID NOT LEARN, at or below **0.3227** | −0.0102 | **−0.42** |
| LEARNED, at or above **0.60** | −0.2875 | **−11.98** |

**Both secondary cells pass**, so the intervention did not break what
works and the run answers the question it was bought for. The primary
battery still learns, at 0.5727 against the 0.50 the cell asks. The
input-channel lesion still collapses it, to 0.1663, a ceiling-corrected
drop of 1.448 — in the same band as the three existing checkpoints.

## Where the verdict is thin, and where it is not

**Thin, and stated rather than glossed.** The control sits 0.42 standard
deviations below the 0.3227 boundary, and across the six evaluation seeds
it ranged 0.2850 to 0.3460 — so **individual draws land on both sides of
that boundary.** The cell is scored on the mean, and the mean is below
it, but a rerun could formally land in PARTIAL. Anyone quoting "DID NOT
LEARN" as a crisp result is quoting it harder than the data supports.

**Not thin at all.** The boundary that carries the reading is 0.60, and
that is **twelve standard deviations away**. Whether the control formally
landed in DID NOT LEARN or scraped the bottom of PARTIAL changes nothing:
on either reading it is indistinguishable from three checkpoints that
received none of this supervision, and it is nowhere near the level that
would show it had learned name-keyed lookup. **The distinction the cells
draw at 0.3227 is not the distinction that matters here.**

## What this settles

**Supervision was not the binding constraint.** That reading has been
live since the 2026-09-17 audit and was never separated from the
alternative. It is separated now: quadrupling the control's per-row
gradient weight bought nothing.

So the remaining explanations are the ones the audit named that are *not*
about supervision — the reversed rendering the control must attend
backwards through, the absence of the private route the acting channel
gives the primary battery, and the fact that its answer appears in no
turn and must be retrieved and then transformed.

**By John's own pre-statement, what is left is option D — teaching plain
name-keyed retrieval before layering the rule on top — or closing A3.**
That is what the pre-statement says, recorded here because it was written
before the number. **It is not a recommendation and nothing is proposed
here.** A3 stays open on John's ruling of 2026-09-19, and the choice is
his.

## Two things worth recording that were not the question

**The coupling cost nothing.** The pre-statement flagged that the state
and syntax batteries would drop from about a third of the training rows
to about a quarter, and watched for damage. The state battery finished at
0.9960 and syntax at 1.0000. It recovered fully; the reallocation was
free.

**The control does fall under the lesion**, from 0.3125 to 0.2613. It is
not inert. That bears on the independent red team's observation that
under this lesion *everything* falls to some degree, and it is reported
here rather than left for someone to find.

## Process, recorded because it will recur

The run completed its full budget and **the final checkpoint was nearly
lost to a race between two safety mechanisms.** The trainer self-terminates
its pod on completion — added after idle billing cost about $9.50 across
three occurrences — and the laptop watchdog performs the final
fetch-and-delete on its roughly ten-minute poll. The trainer finished
between polls, wrote everything, and deleted its own pod before the
watchdog came back. The trainer's own log records both acts on
consecutive lines.

Nothing was lost: checkpoints are written to the network volume, and the
file was recovered intact and checksum-verified for $0.067. But the
locally held copy stopped at step 51,500 until it was, and **this will
happen on every future run that finishes normally.** Full record in
`compute-ledger.md`. No fix is proposed here.

*For the record: the run also billed **zero idle time**, the first in the
programme's history, because self-termination worked exactly as designed.
The same mechanism caused both outcomes.*
