# Amendment A3 to MVM-0a: from an installed register to an acquired center

**Status: REGISTERED 2026-09-15 (see REGISTRATION REVISIONS at the end of this file, which supersede the text above where they conflict). Originally RATIFIED 2026-09-15 by John (all fifteen decisions in §7 answered yes; TimeAssembler decision entry aa11f5e5, "RULED 2026-09-15 — Amendment A3 ratified"). Red-team pass 3 ran (thirteen findings, `red-team-pass-3.md`); Gate 0 ran and K0 did not fire (`gate0-null-calibration-findings.md`); Gate 1 ran and K1 did not fire (`gate1-curriculum-findings.md`); an ownership-blind attack sweep ran and passes. All at $0. The next action is Gate 2, the pilot, which needs John authorization in his own words.**

*Ratified rulings, in short: §1 reading adopted; Candidate A primary; no register in any A3 run; Gate 0 first with K0 hard; three seeds, 3/3 for positive; A3's $100 hard stop outranks repeated-sampling's claim on underspend; gate (iii) arm B scores act-withheld forwards; numbered A3 under the existing $400 all-vendor ceiling; 5-seed run closed as halted at 4/9; no decision on the blind-localization arm; re-indexing probe registered for H_tag; n=400 verdict cells; red-team pass 3 before registration; T_si fix registered with the redesign; lesion script refuses L1 without a lock-hash argument.*

*2026-09-15. Status: **PROPOSAL, not registered.** Nothing below binds until John ratifies it, and ratification is the decisions list at the end, taken one yes/no at a time. Drafted in the pre-registration idiom of `experiments/06-mvm-0a-constructed-self-index/pre-registration.md` (hypotheses with pre-stated signatures, gates, budget, kill criteria, red-team section). Every claim about a prior run cites the file it comes from; every number that is a proposal rather than a measurement is marked as proposed.*

*Binding rulings this proposal sits inside and does not reopen (John, 2026-08-30): wave 3 of the registered 5-seed run is HALTED; the cheap registered null calibration (about $2 to $5) runs first; the battery is then redesigned as a registered amendment; the Amendment A2 ceiling of $400 covers all Minimum Viable Mind compute across every vendor, true spend to date is about $281 to $300, so this amendment must fit roughly $100 to $120; the blind-localization arm is not teed up by this document. The corrigibility commitments in `spec/corrigibility-commitments.md` (v1.1, commit `6c14244`) bind every design choice below.*

*Direction this proposal is built on (John, 2026-09-15): the register-lesion result is a predicted null under the book's own removal test. The register was self-reference, a removable report, a noun installed in a slot; it was not self-location, a doing the binding cannot drop without degrading. So the redesign does not install a register and look for it to matter. It finds or builds a training objective that requires the binding to index its own center in order to succeed, makes that acquired indexing the lesion target, and pre-states task degradation, not report loss, as the signature.*

## Glossary, once, because the shorthand is dense

- **MVM**: Minimum Viable Mind, this research program. **MVM-0a**: its first build, a small transformer trained from scratch on synthetic multi-agent dialogue, registered 2026-08-07.
- **The register**: MVM-0a's designated candidate self-index, N recurrent state vectors (one per agent, marker-keyed, width 32) injected into every layer by cross-attention. **The twin**: the same model with the register removed. **The acting channel** (`act_proj`): a learned projection of the model's own previous-position state injected at the positions where the model itself acts, a motor copy or efference signal (Amendment A1).
- **T_sr, T_si, T_state, T_syntax, T_sr_rev**: the frozen task batteries. T_sr scores retrieving the model's own prior commitment; T_si scores retrieving a named other agent's commitment (self-irrelevant integration); T_state scores ownership-free cross-turn state (counts, ordering); T_syntax is a turn-tracking floor check; T_sr_rev is the split of T_sr on items the model itself revised.
- **d(B)**: chance-corrected drop on battery B under an ablation. **θ (theta) and δ (delta)**: the pre-committed thresholds on d and on the differential between batteries. **Null calibration**: computing θ and δ from the distribution of d under matched-strength random ablations that should not move behavior.
- **RT-nn**: a numbered red-team finding in `red_team_ledger.md`. **C1 to C7**: the seven corrigibility commitments. **A1, A2**: the registered amendments of 2026-08-09 and 2026-08-16. **R1**: the ceiling adjudication addendum of 2026-08-16.
- **Gate (i), (ii), (iii)**: the three cue-detector runs (curriculum text, input tensors, post-training rollouts) that certify no surface cue predicts which turns are the model's own. **Arm A / arm B** of gate (iii): a text classifier on enacted text, and a likelihood attack scoring turn values under the model's own policy. **AUC**: area under the receiver operating curve, 0.5 is chance.
- **OOD**: out of distribution. **NLL**: negative log-likelihood. **CE**: cross-entropy loss. **CI**: confidence interval. **SAE**: sparse autoencoder.
- **Experiment 1**: the self-indexing removal test on a stock 8B instruction-tuned model (`experiments/01-self-indexing-removal-test/`). **Q1** and **Q5**: the roadmap questions "is self-binding absent or present-but-uncarvable?" and "can a self-index be constructed to be load-bearing?" (`ROADMAP-post-removal-test.md` Part 2).
- **J-space**: the "Jacobian lens" workspace reported by Anthropic in July 2026, a sparse set of verbalizable directions that behave as a global workspace and that post-training causes to acquire the Assistant's point of view (`calibration-problem/explorations/comparisons/2026-07-08-anthropic-jspace-global-workspace.md`).
- **ch05**: `calibration-problem/ch05-consciousness-as-assembled-time.md`, cited by section title.

**What was measured.** The pilot seed-0 full model, the only register-bearing run that passed the self batteries, kept every battery score under every lesion of its register: with the cross-attention injection removed entirely, T_si went 0.93 to 0.94 on the registered eval seed and 1.00 to 0.99 on a disjoint replicate, T_sr_rev stayed 1.00, and T_sr, T_state, T_syntax stayed at or above 0.99 (`register-lesion-findings.md`, thread 4 table). The pathway was not dead: removing the injection shifts logits by mean absolute 0.22 and the cross-attention residual norms are large (18 to 275 per block against 3 to 14 for the trunk read). But deranging which register's content is read moves the logits by mean absolute 0.014, so the four registers carry nearly identical content. The findings file's own phrase: "numerically active and informationally inert, a learned bias channel, not an agent-indexed store." Wave 2 had already produced a register-less twin that passed the same batteries at ceiling (T_si 0.96, T_sr_rev 1.00, `twin-binding-anomaly.md`), so no observed binding anywhere in the 30M record is register-dependent.

**What the book's test says about that.** ch05, "The Center That Cannot Be Deleted," draws the line the whole framework rests on: self-reference is "a report the system carries about itself"; self-location is "a structural feature of the binding itself, the act specifying its own center." The test that separates them is removal: "Where binding genuinely indexes its own center, taking the self-location away does not merely silence a report, it degrades the integrated act itself. ... Where a system only represents itself from outside, the same removal subtracts a description and the processing carries on intact. A center is what cannot be deleted without dissolving the integration it centers. A self-model that can be lopped off while the computation proceeds was a description all along."

Read through that sentence, the register lesion is not a surprise. Removal left the processing intact. By the book's own criterion the register "was a description all along," and in fact something weaker than a description, since nothing downstream even read it. It was a noun installed in a slot. The registration anticipated this in §Scope: "the register could be a thing consulted rather than the thing the binding is indexed to," and it recorded that "no result here closes that gap." The gap did not close; it was measured to be the whole distance.

**Why the null was predicted rather than merely possible.** Two features of the design guaranteed that the register could at best become self-reference. First, the register's contents were never required by any objective: the loss was answer-only CE on end-of-episode queries, and the item analysis shows those queries decompose into unique-item lookup (solved by every run), general marker-keyed retrieval (a seed lottery won by two of five runs, register irrelevant), and revised-item recency (`register-lesion-findings.md`, thread 3). A solver never needed to know which agent it was to answer them, so nothing pressed the network to index the binding to a center, and a designated slot with no pressure on it fills with whatever is cheapest, here a bias. Second, the register was symmetric by design (N marker-keyed registers, shared init, no privileged own path, RT-01/RT-02), which was correct for excluding a keyed-slot confound but also meant "which register is mine" was itself something the network would have had to learn under pressure that did not exist.

**The one place a doing was load-bearing.** The record contains a pointer in the other direction. In the three runs that never learned general retrieval, the model's memory of its own first commitments collapsed from T_sr 0.96 to about 0.16 (eight-way chance 0.125) the moment the acting channel was zeroed at eval (`register-lesion-findings.md`, "The acting channel"). That is a mechanism the model could not drop without degrading the task, and it is an act, the motor-copy event, not a stored description. The binders barely used it (T_sr 0.98 without it) because the batteries let them answer by item lookup. So where authorship was load-bearing at 30M it was carried by a doing, and where the design offered a noun the network ignored it. That is exactly the shape ch05's distinction predicts, and it is why the redesign follows the doing.

**The J-space pointer.** ch05, "Where the Rivals Stand," records that the workspace structure Anthropic found "emerged in training" and that "post-training causes the J-space to acquire the Assistant's point of view" (the comparison note, "Their position," item on emergence, and "Divergence" item 2). A point of view was acquired because the post-training task needed one; nobody installed it. The same note names the discriminating experiment ch05 requests: remove the self-directed content alone and watch whether the composed act degrades or only the narration flattens. MVM-0a cannot run that contrast on a stock model, but it can build the small-model analogue: a task that cannot be done without a point of view, a system that acquires one under that pressure, and a lesion of the acquired structure scored on the task.

**What this section does not claim.** It does not claim the architecture failed, nor that a register could never become load-bearing under some other curriculum. It claims the narrower thing the files support: under this objective the register was never required, it became a bias, and the removal test read it correctly. Experiment 1 had already delivered the mirror image on a stock model, a locatable self-structure that was dialogue-state routing and a self-report that no intervention ever subtracted (`removal-test-findings.md`, "The registered verdict"). Between them the two experiments say: what we could find was not a center, and what we installed was not one either. The next design has to make the center something the task earns.
